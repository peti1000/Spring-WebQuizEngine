Implementing Hyperskill Web Quiz Engine project

Stage 1/6: Solving a simple quiz

Description
At the first stage, you need to develop a simple JSON API that always returns the same quiz to be solved. The API should support only two operations: getting the quiz and solving it by passing an answer.

Once the stage is completed, you will have a working web service with a comprehensive API.
